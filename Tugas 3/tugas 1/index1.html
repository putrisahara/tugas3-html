<p><h2> What is Credit Card?</h2>
<p>A Credit Card is an APMK that can be used to make payments for obligations arising from an economic activity, including shopping transactions and/or to make cash withdrawals, where the cardholder's payment obligations are fulfilled first by the acquirer or issuer, and the cardholder is obliged to make payments at the agreed time either by paying in full at once (charge card) or by paying in installments.</p>
<p><h3>Do you need a Credit Card?</h3></p>
    <p>Credit Card is a payment method that gives you convenience in making payments for your financial transactions. However, you must pay attention to the costs and risks that may arise in its use.
        Research shows that consumers tend to spend more when using credit cards than when they use cash.
        Therefore, before you apply for a credit card, think first about your needs and how you will pay the credit card bill.
        Do not use a credit card to pay off your other debts. You can be tied to interest and other fees that will burden you more in the long run.
        If you are trapped in debt, you should see a financial consultant or take advantage of interest-free credit or have a low interest rate to pay it off
